        The Office of School Design and Charter Partnerships (OSDCP) develops new schools and programs, supports school flexibility and redesign through the Progressive Redesign Opportunity for Schools of Excellence (PROSE) initiative and partners with charter schools.  OSDCP represents the NYCDOE as the authorizer of 69 charter schools.

        In school year 2014-15, the DOE will be opening 25 new district schools across all five boroughs, many of these are innovative new models like the NYCPTECH, a new G&T school, a new D75 school as well as several schools that specifically serve Black and Latino young men. In school year 2015-16, the DOE will continue to open new schools that hold promise for innovative approaches to teaching and learning, especially where there are communities that need new options and new construction available.

        New schools are based on community need and the DOE seeks to open school models that reflect deep research and best practices. . Going forward, OSDCP will be developing schools with community input from parents, community based organizations, and youth.  Rather than individual school leaders developing a proposal, we will be seeking experienced principals who can co-construct a vision with the community.

         The Progressive Redesign Opportunity Schools for Excellent (PROSE) program was established as part of the contract between the UFT and the DOE to allow schools to implement innovative plans that fall outside of the Chancellor’s Regulations or UFT contract.
          The PROSE program is designed to:<br>
          <ol>
            <li>Foster continuous innovation to challenge some of the basic rules and regulation under which they have historically operated in service of improved student outcomes.</li>
            <li>Foster collaboration within and across school communities.</li>

    <div id="collapseEight" class="panel-collapse collapse">
      <div class="panel-body">
         Schools submitted a letter of intent indicating their interest in the PROSE program, and then an application signed by the principal, UFT Chapter Chair, and a parent SLT member.
         Applications were reviewed by the DOE and UFT. Schools had to meet three basic requirements:<br>
          <ol>
            <li>Have a proven record of collaboration within the school community.</li>
            <li>Commitment to pursuing innovative ideas with the full support of the SLT and the school community.</li>
            <li>Have the potential to make a strong impact on student learning through the implementation of a creative and bold plan of action</li>
          </ol>
        Schools with successful applications were notified to organize a staff vote. Schools had to gain the support of 65 percent of their UFT staff through a vote in order to become a PROSE school.
